# web_scraper_example
This is a sample repo that shows sourcers who code how to scrape a website. 

Some notes for this repo.
1. The new machine file shows you commands to run on your device once you have ubuntu installed. I would suggest writing them one by one and hitting enter in your terminal. 


2. The update machine file is good to run the commands out of if you have previously used Ubuntu and are not sure if everything is up to date. Again, type a line into your terminal and hit enter. Then repeat for the rest of the lines. 

3. The connect file will not be relevant to anyone else. Disregard that. 

4. The bulk scrape and clean scrape files are 2 others that increase in complexity. Feel free to mess around with those and if anything doesn't work, ask for help!
