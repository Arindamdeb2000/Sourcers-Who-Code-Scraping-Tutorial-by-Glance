# 5 Line Web Scraper

Web Scraper Tutorial Using Python and BeautifulSoup4

## Getting Started

Clone this repo to your machine and pip install -r requirements.txt to get up and running. There are multiple examples in this repo. I would suggest starting with basic_scrapper.py and working through the notes to understand what is happening. Next, I would suggest looking at list_of_leads to understand how I wrote a scraper to grab 900 leads and save them into a list together. 

## Installation

Clone this repo to your local machine and then pip install -r requirements.txt. 

Then run 

```
python basic_scraper.py
```
